        With a background in hospitality I have gained numerous people & problem
        solving skills over the years. My favourite part of the job ended up
        being the problem solving & making things more efficient to run better.
        Coming into the world of programming and more specifically the web
        developers world it has allowed me to keep problem solving on a day to
        day.

        working.

          the me reliable transport I would need to work in the position. Im
          looking for my first big step into the web developers field. Willing
          to give all my time when needed to become a better programmer!
